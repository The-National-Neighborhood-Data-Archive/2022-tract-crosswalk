# Using the CT 2022 Tract Crosswalk with NaNDA Datasets

## Background

In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau adopted Connecticut's nine planning regions as county equivalents, replacing the state's eight counties for statistical purposes. This change created new FIPS codes for Connecticut census tracts.

National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA) datasets use 2020 census geography. This repository provides tools to update NaNDA tract-level datasets to reflect Connecticut's 2022 geography boundaries.

## What's Included

- **Crosswalk files** (CSV, Stata, Excel formats): Links 879 Connecticut census tracts to towns, counties, county equivalents, ZIP codes, 2020 PUMAs, and secondary school districts
- **Stata script** (`nanda_ct_2022_2020_tract_crosswalk.do`): Code for applying the crosswalk to NaNDA datasets
- **Original documentation** (`CT_DATA_COLLABORATIVE_README.md`): Complete technical documentation from CT Data Collaborative

## How to Use

1. Download NaNDA 2020 tract-level dataset from [NaNDA's ICPSR Repository](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sites/nanda/home)
2. Download the appropriate crosswalk file format (CSV, Stata .dta, or Excel)
3. Run the Stata script `use_ct_2022_2020_tract_crosswalk.do`, adjusting file paths as needed
4. The script will merge the crosswalk with your NaNDA data and update Connecticut tract identifiers to 2022 boundaries

The script adds a `tract_fips22` variable to the NaNDA dataset. **For analyses using data from 2022 or later thats include Connecticut, use `tract_fips22` instead of `tract_fips20`** to ensure correct geographic alignment with Census Bureau products.
